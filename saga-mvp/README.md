# SAGA Provider — MVP

A minimal, working implementation of the SAGA Provider: user registration,
agent registration with real Ed25519 signature verification, contact-policy
enforcement, and OTK issuance on lookup. This is Phase 1 of the build plan —
no proxy or agents yet, just a Provider you can register against and query.

## Project layout

```

├── docker-compose.yml
├── certs/
│   └── generate_certs.sh      # self-signed TLS cert for local dev
└── saga-provider/
    ├── Dockerfile
    ├── requirements.txt
    ├── client_example.py      # working example: register + lookup
    └── app/
        ├── main.py            # FastAPI endpoints
        ├── crypto.py          # Provider signing key + signature verification
        ├── models.py          # request/response schemas

        └── db.py              # MongoDB (motor) connection
```

## Setup

1. **Generate a TLS cert** (self-signed, for local dev):
   ```bash
   bash certs/generate_certs.sh
   ```

2. **Start everything**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
   This starts MongoDB and the Provider on `https://localhost:8443`.
   The Provider's own signing keypair is generated on first boot and
   persisted in the `provider_keys` Docker volume — it survives restarts.

3. **Check it's alive**:
   ```bash
   curl -k https://localhost:8443/health
   ```

## Try it out

`client_example.py` shows the full client-side flow: generating Ed25519/X25519
keypairs, registering two users (Alice, Bob), registering their agents with
correctly-signed metadata and OTKs, and having Alice look up Bob (which
checks Bob's contact policy and issues an OTK).

```bash
pip install pynacl httpx
python saga-provider/client_example.py
```

Expected output ends with a successful lookup response containing Bob's
endpoint info and a fresh OTK.

## API summary

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /users/register` | Register a user (`uid`, `password`, Ed25519 verify key) |
| `POST /agents/register` | Register an agent under a user, with a signed contact policy and a batch of signed OTKs |
| `PUT /agents/{aid}/policy` | Update an agent's contact policy (resets OTK budgets) |
| `POST /agents/{aid}/deactivate` | Deactivate an agent (owner only) |
| `GET /agents/{aid}/lookup?initiator_aid=...` | Initiating agent requests target's info + a fresh OTK; enforced by the target's contact policy |

## What's simplified vs. the full SAGA paper (intentionally, for MVP speed)

- **Auth**: plain password + SHA-256 hash instead of OpenID Connect + human
  verification. Fine for a local MVP; swap in real OIDC before this touches
  anything real.
- **TLS certs for agents**: agents currently trust the pubkeys the Provider
  hands back on lookup, rather than a CA-issued cert chain. Add a small
  internal CA (even a self-signed root + `openssl ca`) if you want to match
  the paper exactly.
- **No RAFT/sharding**: single Provider instance. Not needed until you're
  benchmarking scalability like the paper does in Section VI-D.
- **Contact-policy specificity**: uses "literal character count" of the glob
  pattern as a proxy for the paper's specificity ranking — good enough for
  an MVP, but worth revisiting if you have overlapping wildcard rules.

## Signing scheme (needed for your agent/proxy code later)

Agent registration signs the JSON `{"aid", "device", "ip", "port", "pac"}`
with `sort_keys=True` compact encoding, using the user's Ed25519 signing key.
Each OTK is signed separately as the raw bytes of the string
`f"{aid}:{otk_hex}"`. `client_example.py` implements this exactly — reuse it
when you build the agent containers and the security proxy, since the proxy
will need to verify these same signatures when it validates tokens.

## Next

This gives you a working Provider. Next up: the two agent containers
(Alice/Bob, using `smolagents` + Google Calendar) doing the DH handshake and
token exchange directly over TLS — Phase 1 of the build plan — before
inserting the security proxy in Phase 2.
